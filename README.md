# AI project on solving multiple instances of 8 puzzle problem

• Implemented A* Search and hill climbing algorithms for solving 1000 instances of 8-puzzle problem.

• Administered file handling in C++ and Python for data storage and retrieval.

• Visualised results with Matplotlib for graphical comparison of performance of algorithms.

This project was implemented using C++ (Ai.cpp), results are stored in a csv file (results.csv) and visualisations of the results have been done using Python (python.py, search_costs.png & success_rates.png). Problem statement, background, methodology, solution, overall outcomes have been mentioned in the project report (n_puzzle.pdf).
